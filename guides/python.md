# Python setup

Run `brew install pyenv`, so you can easily manage multiple Python versions on your machine.

Your machine will use the system Python version by default - you never want to run commands using the system Python version.  Install pyenv before running any Python commands.

Download a different Python version and set the global Python version to be different than the system Python.

Read [this blog post to actually understand how pyenv works](https://mungingdata.com/python/how-pyenv-works-shims/).
