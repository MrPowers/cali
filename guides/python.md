# Python setup

Run `brew install pyenv`, so you can easily manage multiple Python versions on your machine.

Your machine will use the system Python version by default - you never want to run commands using the system Python version.  Install pyenv before running any Python commands.

Read [this blog post to actually understand how pyenv works](https://mungingdata.com/python/how-pyenv-works-shims/).

Run `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -` to install Poetry [as described here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
