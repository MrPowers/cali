# Terminal

The default shell has been changed from Bash to ZSH as of macOS Catalina.  All commands in this guide use the `~/.zshrc` file instead of the `~/.bash_profile`.

[Use the Option key as the meta key](https://stackoverflow.com/a/327676) by going to Terminal > Preferences > Profiles > Keyboard and checking the "Use Option as Meta key" box.

In the Terminal > Profiles > Text tab, set the color theme to Novel and the font to 16 pt.  You need to click the "Default" button in the bottom left to save these settings.

## zshrc
