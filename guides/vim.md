# Vim

cali helps you build a custom Vim setup.  It's not a full blown Vim distribution like Janus or spf-13.  cali is much more lightweight.

Hardcore Vim users hate Vim distributions, [see here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4637100) [and here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/bfyg3p/what_do_you_think_about_these_vim_distribution_on/).

I don't think Vim distributions deserve the hate.  It's best to start with a distribution, get comfortable with Vim, and switch to a custom setup when you're more comfortable.

Yehuda Katz [learned Vim with a distribution](https://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/).  I used the [janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) library Yehuda contributed to for 5 years before spilling tea on my laptop and getting motivated to create a custom setup.

Advances in Vim makes building a custom setup easier.  [You don't need a package manager for Vim plugins anymore](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57738713/1125159)

## Other Vim distributions


## Custom plugin installations

You can just clone repos in the `~/.vim/pack/bundle/start` directory.

## Lightweight distribution



## Janus like distribution

Janus [contains these plugins](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus/blob/60e6864fbd60dc8efa9dc4c6de40b7615452814c/.gitmodules).
