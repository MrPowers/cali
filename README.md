An extraordinarly lightweight Vim distribution.

Doesn't contain any Vimscript... only contains a couple of tiny Shell scripts.

Hardcore Vim users hate Vim distributions, [see here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4637100) [and here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/bfyg3p/what_do_you_think_about_these_vim_distribution_on/).

Yehuda Katz [learned Vim a different way](https://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/) and eventually helped create [janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus).

The Yehuda Katz / Janus learning approach worked for me.  Now that I've been using Vim for years, I'm in a better place to think og a custom setup.

Programming is overwhelming at the beginning and smart defaults like Janus are what can help you learn to love a technology like Vim.

[You don't need a package manager for Vim plugins anymore](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57738713/1125159).  You can just clone repos in the `~/.vim/pack/bundle/start` directory.
