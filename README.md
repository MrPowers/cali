This repo contains scripts to provision your development environment.

Understanding the details of your machine setup helps you debug issues.  This guide will remind you how to get new machines setup quickly.  It's not meant to be a single command setup.  It's better for you to go through the commands one-by-one, so you can customize your machine accordingly.

## Forking is encouraged

Most "machine setup" type repos discourage forking and provide other customization options.  The design philosophy for this repo is the opposite.  Fork it and make it your own.

## Custom executables
