This repo contains scripts to provision your development environment.

It's designed for control freaks that want to understand all the code in their `.bash_profile`, `.vimrc`, and emacs config files.

## Forking is encouraged

Fork this repo and customize it for your needs!  This is meant to be a starting point for your own custom setup.

Most "machine setup" type repos discourage forking and provide other customization options.  The design philosophy for this repo is the opposite.  Fork it and make it your own.
